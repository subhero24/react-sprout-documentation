# Query

Query strings in the route configuration can be used to match urls with a query string.
You need to specify in the route configuration what parts of the url query string the component needs.

### Search params with a value

Specifying a query string with assigned values will only render the corresponding route if the url also has the same search param with that value.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Admin path="admin">
		<Users path="content?section=users" />
		<Posts path="content?section=posts" />
		<Other path="content" />
	</Admin>,
)
```

### Search params with no value

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="users?search=">
	</Root>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="users?type=admin&search">
	</Root>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="users?search">
	</Root>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="products/shoes?brand=nike&brand=adidas">
	</Root>,
)
```

<Note>
	Specifying the query params in the configuration allows the query string to participate in the route matching algorithm.
	It also enables very fine-grained data loading and caching.

It also allows very fine-grained data loading in your components.
