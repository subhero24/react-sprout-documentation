# Server api

When specifying actions and loaders on the client, you have to call an existing api to get these actions and loaders to do something on the server.

If you do not have an existing api yet, you can choose to specify the actions and loaders on the server, and let react sprout create the api for you.

```javascript
import Express from 'express';
import Routes from 'react-sprout/express';

import Root, { action as rootAction } from './routes/root.js';
import Todo, { loader as todoLoader } from './routes/todo.js';
import Todos, { loader as todosLoader } from './routes/todos.js';

let Router = Routes(
	<Root action={rootAction}>
		<Todo path="todos/:todoId" loader={todoLoader} />
		<Todos path="todos" loader={todosLoader} />
	</Root>,
);

let application = Express();

application.use(Router);
application.listen(4000);
```

As this code runs on the server, you can directly access the database in the actions and loaders

```javascript
export function loader({ request }) {
	return request.db.all(`SELECT * FROM todos`);
}
```

As nothing is rendered on the server the route component itself will be ignored. An empty route component can be used.

```javascript
export default function Todos() {}

export function loader({ request }) {
	return request.db.all(`SELECT * FROM todos`);
}
```

If you prefer not to create empty route components, specifying the routes as plain objects is also supported:

```javascript
let Router = Routes({
	action: rootAction,
	children: [
		{ path: 'todos/:todoId', loader: todoLoader },
		{ path: 'todos', loader: todosLoader },
	],
});
```

On the client, not specifying an action or loader implementation will use the server api of the corresponding server route.

```javascript
import Routes from 'react-sprout';

let Router = Routes(
	<Root action>
		<Todo path="todos/:todoId" loader />
		<Todos path="todos" loader />
	</Root>,
);
```

You will need to keep the routes from the server api in sync with the routes used in the client.
