# Paths

The route `path` property has some more advanced tricks up its sleeve.

<Error>
	Some `path` tricks are very powerful for all kinds of things. But with great
	power comes great responsibility. Parent segments and absolute paths are not
	necessarily recommended practice. Use them wisely.
</Error>

Specifying trailing slashes for example. They need no special treatment, if you want trailing slashes, just write them in the route configation.

```javascript
<Todos path="todos/">
```

Some filesystem navigation syntax like `.` and `..` is also supported.

```javascript
<TodosLayout path="todos">
	<Todos path="./" />
	<Todo path=":todoId" />
</TodosLayout>
```

```javascript
<App path=":language">
	<Todos path="todos" />
	<FrenchTodos path="../fr/todos" />
</App>
```

Or combined with the splat to match the last segment of an url.

```javascript
<File path="files/*/../2024" />
```

Even absolute paths are allowed.

```javascript
<App path=":language">
	<Admin path="admin">
		<Users path="users/:userId">
		<FirstUser path="/en/admin/users/1" />
	</Admin>
</App>
```
