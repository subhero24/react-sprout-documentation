absoute relative path properties
trailing slashes

Advanced splat usage

```javascript
<Root path="/*/../test">
    		<Files path="files/*">
    	</Root>
```

There are no special rules for urls with a trailing `/`, if your url needs to end in a slash, just write them in the routes.
This configuration will only a matching url for `/admin/users/`.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root path="/">
		<Admin path="admin/">
			<Users path="users/" />
		</Admin>
	</Root>,
)
```

The trailing `/` in the path property of the `Admin` route is competely optional, as the router knows there must be a `/` between `admin` and `users` in the url.
It thus can be omitted and we will do so for every parent route in the configuration from now on.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root path="/">
		<Admin path="admin">
			<Users path="users/" />
		</Admin>
	</Root>,
)
```

Even the path property from the `Root` route is not necessary as matching will always start from the beginning of the url. So the idiomatic way of writing this config would be:

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<Admin path="admin">
			<Users path="users/" />
		</Admin>
	</Root>,
)
```
