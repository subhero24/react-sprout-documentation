# Paths

The route `path` property allows more complex matching than just url segments.

Trailing slashes for example need no special treatment. If you want a trailing slash, write them in the route configuration.

```javascript
<Todos path="todos/">
```

This configuration will only match `/todos/` but not `/todos`.

Some filesystem syntax is also supported.

```javascript
<TodosLayout path="todos">
	<Todos path="./" />
	<Todo path=":todoId" />
</TodosLayout>
```

The Todos route component will render at `/todos/`.

	The following `path` tricks are very powerful for all kinds of things. But
	with great power comes great responsibility. They are not necessarily
	recommended practice. Use them wisely.
</Error>

The parent operator `..` from the filesystem syntax is also supported.

```javascript
<App path=":language">
	<Todos path="todos" />
	<FrenchTodos path="../fr/todos" />
</App>
```

Or combined with the splat to match the last segment of an url.

```javascript
<File path="files/*/../2024" />
```

The File route component wil render at any url starting with `files` and ending in `2024`, like `files/2024` and `files/documents/01/05/2024`.

You can even use absolute paths.

```javascript
<App path=":language">
	<Admin path="admin">
		<Users path="users/:userId">
		<FirstUser path="/en/admin/users/1" />
	</Admin>
</App>
```
