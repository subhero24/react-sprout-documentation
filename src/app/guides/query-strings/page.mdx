# Query strings

Query strings in the route configuration can be used to match urls with a query string.
You need to specify in the route configuration what parts of the url query string the component needs.

### Search params with an assigned value

Specifying a query string with search params with assigned values will only match the corresponding route if the url also has the same search param with that value.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<>
		<Users path="sections?section=users" />
		<Posts path="sections?section=posts" />
		<Other path="sections" />
	</>,
)
```

### Search params with an epmty assignment

Specifying a query string with search params with empty assignments will only render the corresponding route if the url also has the same search param regardless of the value.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<>
		<Users path="users" />
		<UserSearch path="users?search=" />
	</>,
)
```

### Search params without assignment

Specifying a query string with search params without values will only render the corresponding route if the url also has the same search param regardless of the value.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<>
		<Users path="users?search">
	</>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="users?type=admin&search">
	</Root>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="users?search">
	</Root>,
)
```

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<UserSearch path="products/shoes?brand=nike&brand=adidas">
	</Root>,
)
```

<Note>
	Specifying the query params in the configuration allows the query string to participate in the route matching algorithm.
	It also enables very fine-grained data loading and caching.

It also allows very fine-grained data loading in your components.
