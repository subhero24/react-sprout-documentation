# Requests

When using a router in the a browser, it will by default use the browser request url to render and update after navigation.

To make a router independent of the browser, a request must be passed to the router element as a prop.
There are two properties used to pass a request to the router; `request` and `defaultRequest`.
These are similar to how controlled and uncontrolled inputs work with `value` and `defaultValue`.

### Controlled router

A controlled router uses the `request` prop to control what the router renders.

```javascript
function Application() {
	return <Router request={request} />;
}
```

If you want this router to navigate to another page, the request prop needs to change externally.

```javascript
function Application() {
	let [request, setRequest] = useState(() => new Request('/some/url'));

	function handleNavigate(event) {
		setRequest(event.detail.request);
	}

	return <Router request={request} onNavigate={handleNavigate} />;
}
```

### Uncontrolled router

An uncontrolled router uses the `defaultRequest` prop to control what the router initially renders, but will render other pages when navigating internally without externally changing the request.

```javascript
function Application() {
	return <Router defaultRequest={request} />;
}
```

<hr />

The `Request` component can also be used to pass a request to the router instead of passing the request as a prop to the router element.

It also has the same controlled and uncontrolled variants with the `value` and `defaultValue` prop.

```javascript
function Application() {
	return (
		<Request value={request}>
			<Router />
		</Request>
	);
}
```

```javascript
function Application() {
	return (
		<Request defaultValue={request}>
			<Router />
		</Request>
	);
}
```

<Warning>
	In some environments a global `Request` variable already exists. Be careful when importing the Request component as it will override the global variable.
	It may be needed to rename the component while importing.
	
	```javascript
	import { Request as RequestProvider } from 'react-sprout'

    let request = new Request('/some/url')

    function Application() {
    	return (
    		<RequestProvider defaultValue={request}>
    			<Router />
    		</RequestProvider>
    	);
    }
    ```

</Warning>

This is more convenient when the router element is burried deep down inside the component tree.

It is also often used in server side rendering. The server can wrap the whole application in a `<Request>` element and be done with it.

```javascript
function Application() {
	return (
		<html>
			<head>...</head>
			<body>
				<Router />
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}

<Request value={request}>
	<Application />
</Request>;
```
