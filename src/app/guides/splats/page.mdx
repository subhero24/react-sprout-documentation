# Splats

Splats in the route configuration can be used to match anything that follows.
A splat is written as an asterisk and defines a placeholder for the rest of the url.
It must be the last part of the url. Splats in the middle of a url are not allowed.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root>
		<Files path="files/*">
	</Root>,
)
```

Urls like `/files/images/image-001.jpg` or `/files/documents/reports/2024/05/11` will match the general form `/files/*` and the router will render these urls with the layout

```javascript
<Root>
	<Files>
</Root>
```

The splat will be accessible inside the route components with the [useSplat](/hooks/use-splat) hook.

```javascript
function Root() {
	let splat = useSplat() // ['files', 'documents', 'reports', '2024', '05', '11']
}
```

Only the parts of the url that are not specified in the configuration will be part of the splat.

```javascript
function Files() {
	let splat = useSplat() // ['documents', 'reports', '2024', '05', '11']
}
```

<Warning>
	Defining splats for parent routes is not very useful, as they will match the rest of the url by default.
	Only the deepest child routes need to specify the splat if they are interested in the rest of the url.

    ```javascript
    let Router = Routes(
    	<Root path="/*">
    		<Files path="files/*">
    	</Root>,
    )
    ```

</Warning>
