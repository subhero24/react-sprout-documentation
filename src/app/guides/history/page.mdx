# History

Information about the history is accessible through the [useHistory](/hooks/use-history) hook.

<Info>
	Always use this hook instead of using `window.history` directly, as concurrent
	rendering with react causes multiple different histories to exist at the same
	time.
</Info>

```javascript
function Route() {
	let history = useHistory()
		...
}
```

History conforms the [History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) interface, so take a look at this native web platform api if you are not familiar.

<Warning>
	Be aware that the history is only available in the browser. Take into account
	that history is `undefined` when rendering on the server.
</Warning>
