# History

Information about the history is accessible through the [useHistory](/hooks/use-history) hook.

```javascript
function Route() {
	let history = useLocation()
		...
}
```

History conforms the [History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) interface, so take a look at this native web platform api if you are not familiar.
