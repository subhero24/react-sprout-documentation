# Routes

The routes in the routes configuration represent the user interface of your application.
As most user interfaces are hierarchical in nature, so can the routes be nested to represent shared pieces of user interface.

```javascript
import Routes from 'react-sprout';

import App from './app.jsx';
import Home from './home.jsx';
import Admin from './admin.jsx';
import Users from './users.jsx';
import Posts from './posts.jsx';

let Router = Routes(
	<App path="app">
		<Home path="home" />
		<Admin path="admin">
			<Users path="users" />
			<Posts path="posts" />
		</Admin>
	</App>,
);
```

The `Router` element will progressively match segments from the current url to the nested path properties of the routes to figure out what to render.

The url `/app/admin/posts` for example has three segments; `app`, `admin` and `posts` which will respectively match the paths of the `App`, `Admin`, and `Posts` routes.
These matched routes form the element structure for the page at this url.

```javascript
<App>
	<Admin>
		<Posts />
	</Admin>
</App>
```

A route component can render its child route like any other react component would, by using `props.children`:

```javascript
function Admin(props) {
	return (
		<main>
			<h1>Admin</h1>
			<section>{props.children}</section>
		</main>
	);
}
```

<Info>
	Note that there is no page at `/app/admin`, as the url matching keeps going until there are no chid routes left to match.

    If you also wanted a page at `/app/admin`, the routes configuration would look like this

    ```javascript
    let Router = Routes(
    	<App path="app">
    		<Home path="home" />
    		<Admin path="admin" />
    		<AdminLayout path="admin">
    			<Users path="users" />
    			<Posts path="posts" />
    		</AdminLayout>
    	</App>,
    );
    ```

</Info>

<hr />

While each route in the previous example specified exactly one segment of the url, this is not a requirement. A route does not need to add anything to the url, or it can specify multiple url segments at once.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<App path="app">
		<Home />
		<Admin path="admin">
			<Users path="users" />
			<Posts path="content/posts" />
		</Admin>
	</App>,
);
```

- The `Home` route does not have a path property and will not add anything to the url, so will be rendered at `/app`.
- The `Posts` route adds 2 url segments at once to the url, it will be rendered at `/app/admin/content/posts`.

<hr />

<Info>
	If the `Admin` route does not render anything but `props.children`, it is not necessary to group the `Users` and `Posts` routes.
	This is also a viable route configuration:

    ```javascript
    let Router = Routes(
    	<App>
    		<Home />
    		<Users path="admin/users" />
    		<Posts path="admin/content/posts" />
    	</App>,
    )
    ```

    You should however always group multiple routes if there is a shared piece of user interface. And let the parent take care of rendering that shared part of the user interface.
