# Routes

The routes in the routes configuration represent the user interface of your application.
As most user interfaces are hierarchical in nature, so can the routes be nested to represent shared pieces of user interface.

```javascript
import Routes from 'react-sprout'

import Root from './root.jsx'
import Home from './home.jsx'
import Admin from './admin.jsx'
import Users from './users.jsx'
import Posts from './posts.jsx'

let Router = Routes(
	<Root path="/">
		<Home path="home" />
		<Admin path="admin/">
			<Users path="users" />
			<Posts path="posts" />
		</Admin>
	</Root>,
)
```

The Router will find a subset of routes to render by matching the url to the nested path properties.

In this example the url `/admin/posts` would first match the path property `/` from the `Root` route, then `admin/` from the `Admin` route, and finally `posts` from the `Posts` route.

The matched routes are `Root` > `Admin` > `Posts` and these form the layout the Router will use to render the page at `/admin/posts`. The Router will effectively render the filtered elements:

```javascript
<Root>
	<Admin>
		<Posts />
	</Admin>
</Root>
```

A route component can render its child route like any other react component would, by using `props.children`:

```javascript
function Admin(props) {
	return (
		<main>
			<h1>Admin</h1>
			<section>{props.children}</section>
		</main>
	)
}
```

<hr />

While each route in the previous example specified one segment of the url, this is not a requirement. A route does not need to add anything to the url, or it can specify multiple segments at once.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<Root path="/">
		<Home />
		<Admin path="admin/">
			<Users path="users" />
			<Posts path="content/posts" />
		</Admin>
	</Root>,
)
```

- The `Home` route does not have a path property and will not add anything to the url, so will be rendered at `/`.
- The `Posts` route adds 2 segments at once to the url, so it will be rendered at `/admin/content/posts`.

<Note>
	Remember that it is not the url that determines the nesting structure of your routes. You should not nest two routes within a common parent only because their urls have something in common.
	They should be nested inside a common parent however, if both routes render the same piece of the user interface. And this parent should be responsible for rendering the shared part.

    While `Users` and `Posts` can both be found at `/admin/`, if they do not have anything in common besides the `admin` part of the url, it is preferred to have a route configuration like this:

    ```javascript
    let Router = Routes(
    	<Root path="/">
    		<Users path="admin/users" />
    		<Posts path="admin/posts" />
    	</Root>,
    )
    ```

</Note>
