# Relative navigation

The `href` attribute of a [Link](/components/link), the `action` attribute of a [Form](/components/form), and the `to` parameter to the [navigate](/hooks/use-navigate#navigate) function
all specify the target url of a navigation.

By default, relative targets are relative to the path of the route that does the navigation.

```javascript
import Routes, { Link } from 'react-sprout';

let Router = Routes(
	<App>
		<Admin path="admin">
			<Tags path="tags" />
			<Tag path="tags/:tagId" />
		</Admin>
	</App>,
);

function Admin(props) {
	return (
		<main>
			<h1>Admin</h1>
			<nav>
				<Link href="tags">Tags</Link>
			</nav>
			<section>{props.children}</section>
		</main>
	);
}
```

The Link element that is rendered by the Admin route component uses a relative target `tags`.
It will always resolve to `/admin/tags` as all relative targets inside the Admin route component will be relative to `/admin`.
This makes relative navigation predictable as they always resolve to the same url, regardless of the current url.

This "route relative" behavior can be disabled by setting `relative` to `false`, causing navigation targets to be relative to the current url instead.

```javascript
function Admin(props) {
	return (
		<main>
			<h1>Admin</h1>
			<nav>
				<Link href=".." relative={false}>
					Up
				</Link>
			</nav>
			<section>{props.children}</section>
		</main>
	);
}
```

This will make the target url of the Link dependent on the current url:

- When the current url is `/admin/tags`, the Link would refer to `/admin`.
- When the current url is `/admin/tags/1`, the Link would refer to `/admin/tags`.

<Info>
	If you ever need to resolve paths in the same way the router does, without
	actually navigating, there is a [useResolve](/hooks/use-resolve) hook to do just that.

    ```javascript
    import { useResolve } from 'react-sprout'

    function UpLink(props) {
    	let href = useResolve('..', { relative: false })

    	return <a href={href}>Up</a>
    }
    ```
