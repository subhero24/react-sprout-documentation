# Responses

Actions and loaders return data which can be used in route components with the [useActionResult](/hooks/use-action-result) and [useLoaderResult](/hooks/use-loader-result) hooks. A canonical example of a loader that fetches the data from an api would look something like this;

```javascript
async function todosLoader() {
	let response = await fetch('/api/todos.json');
	let todos = await response.json();

	return todos;
}
```

Returning a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) in an action or loader is also supported.
The response will automatically be read and parsed to be used as the action or loader result in the route component. So the previous loader example could also be implemented even more concisely.

```javascript
function todosLoader() {
	return fetch('/api/todos.json');
}
```
