# Location

All information about the current URL besides splats and params can be found in the `location` object, which is accessible through the [useLocation](/hooks/use-location) hook.

<Info>
	Always use this hook instead of using `window.location` directly, as
	concurrent rendering with react causes multiple different locations to exist
	at the same time.
</Info>

```javascript
function Route() {
	let location = useLocation()
		...
}
```

Location is an instance of [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL), so take a look at this native web platform api if you are not familiar.
