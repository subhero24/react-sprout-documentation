# Roots

A root route will act as the root when its children are navigating to absolute urls. Roots are useful to contain an application, or a part of it, at a base url.

Add a root property in the route configuration to mark a route as a root route.

```javascript
import Routes, { Link } from 'react-sprout'

let Router = Routes(
	<App path="app" root>
		<Todos path="todos" />
		<Todo path="todos/:todoId" />
	</App>
)

function Todo() {
	...

	return <>
		<Link href="/todos">Todos</Link>

		...
	</>
}
```

The absolute link inside the Todo route component will link to `/app/todos` instead of `/todos` because the App route component which is found at `/app` is a root route.
