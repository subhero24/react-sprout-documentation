# Sticky navigation

By default, navigation to a new page will show the new page immediately.
Routes of the new page that need to load their data with loaders, will have very little to show but a loading indicator.

Sticky navigation waits with the navigation, while data for the new routes is loaded in the background.
Once all data is loaded, the new page will show with all data ready to render, avoiding loading indicators on the new page.

To do a sticky navigation, add the `sticky` property to the Link or Form element;

```javascript
<Link href="/" sticky={true}>
	Home
</Link>

<Form action="/" method="post" sticky={true}>
	...
</Form>
```

Or use the `sticky` option when navigating programmatically;

```javascript
navigate('/', { sticky: true });
```

<Info>
A more elegant way to specify the sticky property on a Link or Form element is to set the property without a value. React assumes an element property value to be true when no value is given.

```javascript
<Link href="/" sticky>
	Home
</Link>

<Form action="/" method="post" sticky>
	...
</Form>
```
