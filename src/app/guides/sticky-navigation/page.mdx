# Sticky navigation

By default, a navigation to a new page will show the new page immediately.
Parts of the new page that need to load their data with loaders, will have very little to show but a loading indicator.

A sticky navigation however will wait on the current page and loads data for the new page in the background.
Once data is available, the new page will show with all data ready to render, avoiding loading indicators on the new page.

To do a sticky navigation, add the `sticky` property to the Link or Form element;

```javascript
<Link href="/" sticky>
	Home
</Link>

<Form action="/" method="post" sticky>
	...
</Form>
```

Or use the `sticky` option if navigating programmatically;

```javascript
navigate('/', { sticky: true });
```
