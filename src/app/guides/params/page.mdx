# Params

Parameters can be used in the route configuration to match urls with dynamic values.
A parameter starts with a colon and defines a placeholder in the url for a value.

```javascript
let Router = Routes(
	<App path=":language">
		<User path="users/:userId">
	</App>,
)
```

Urls like `/en/users/1` and `/es/users/42` will both match the general form `/:language/users/:userId` and the router will render both urls with this layout

```javascript
<App>
	<User>
</App>
```

The parameter names, as defined in the configuration, and their extracted values will be accessible inside the route components with the [useParams](/hooks/use-params) hook.

```javascript
function App() {
	let { language } = useParams()
		...
}
```

Each route component also has access to the parameters of parent routes.

```javascript
function User() {
	let { language, userId } = useParams()
		...
}
```
