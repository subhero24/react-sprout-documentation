# Request

A component to provide an external request for the Router component.

This component is useful when doing server side rendering or creating a router that is independent of the browser.

<Info>
The Router component itself also has properties [`request`](/components/router#request) and [`defaultRequest`](/components/router#default-request) to provide an external request,
but adding the request as a property to the `<Router>` element can be inconvenient when the `<Router>` element is used deep inside the component tree.
</Info>

```javascript
import { Request } from 'react-sprout';

function Application() {
	return (
		<html>
			<head>...</head>
			<body>
				<Router />
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}

<Request value={someRequest}>
	<Application />
</Request>;
```

<Warning>
In some environments a global `Request` variable already exists. Be careful when importing the Request component as it will override the global variable.
It may be needed to rename the component while importing.
 
```javascript
import { Request as RequestProvider } from 'react-sprout'

let someRequest = new Request('/some/url')

<RequestProvider value={someRequest}>
	<Application />
</RequestProvider>
```

</Warning>
