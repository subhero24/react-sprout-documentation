# Router

Groups are where communities live in Protocol â€” they are a collection of contacts you're talking to all at once. On this page, we'll dive into the different group endpoints you can use to manage groups programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete groups. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The group model

The group model contains all the information about your groups, including what contacts are in the group and the group's name, description, and avatar.
