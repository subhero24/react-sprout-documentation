# useHistory

A hook to get the history.

<Info>
	Always use this hook instead of using `window.history` directly, as concurrent
	rendering with react allows multiple concurrent histories to be in use.
</Info>

```javascript
import { useHistory } from 'react-sprout';

let history = useHistory();
```

<Warning>
	Be aware that the history is only available on the client. Take into account
	that history is `undefined` when rendering on the server.
</Warning>

<Properties>
	<Property name="history" type="History">
		The history
	</Property>
</Properties>
