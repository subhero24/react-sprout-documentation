# useLocation

A hook to get the current location.

<Info>
	Always use this hook instead of using `window.location` directly, as
	concurrent rendering with react will allow multiple concurrent locations to be
	in use.
</Info>

```javascript
import { useLocation } from 'react-sprout';

let location = useLocation();
```

<Properties>
	<Property name="location" type="URL">
		The current location of the router
	</Property>
</Properties>
